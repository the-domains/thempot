  Bad news for Roy G. Biv. Scientists have discovered there are a dozen
  different types of rainbows, many of which don't include the colors Red,
  Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet. To be fair, Roy G. Biv has
  always been a misnomer since scientists don't consider indigo a unique color
  of the rainbow.
